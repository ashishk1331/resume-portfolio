I've been listening to _Blood Harmony_ constantly for over a week now. It’s one of Finneas’s greatest works. For those who may not know, **Blood Harmony** is the debut EP by Finneas—Billie Eilish’s brother. It was released in October 2019 and contains seven tracks:

1. _"I Lost a Friend"_
2. _"Shelter"_
3. _"Lost My Mind"_
4. _"I Don't Miss You at All"_
5. _"Partners in Crime"_
6. _"Let's Fall in Love for the Night"_
7. _"Die Alone"_

With this, I’m starting a monthly series where I share an album or EP I deeply care about and discuss its tracks and themes.

I first heard _Blood Harmony_ around the fall of 2021. Since then, at the start of every autumn, either _"Lost My Mind"_ or _"Let's Fall in Love for the Night"_ seems to resurface in my playlists. This year, the flavor lingered longer than usual—so why not share the taste with everyone?

Everything I discuss here reflects my personal opinions and interpretations of the EP and its tracks.

If I could define this EP in one phrase, it would be _hopeless romantic_. The tracks explore themes of emotional turmoil—separation, yearning, madness, and nostalgia. There's a haunting void echoed in lyrics like:

> There's an empty space beside me,  
> And I'll keep it that way until you're here,  
> I need you here.

I adore the veiled loneliness that’s so beautifully woven into the songs. This EP feels like the culmination of Finneas’s earlier works and scattered creative threads. And yet, each track fits the overall theme so perfectly.

The sequencing of the tracks also showcases a clever duality. _"I Lost a Friend"_, _"Lost My Mind"_, and _"Die Alone"_ explore grief—of loss, of sanity, of the self. Meanwhile, _"Shelter"_, _"I Don't Miss You at All"_, _"Partners in Crime"_, and _"Let's Fall in Love for the Night"_ are more upbeat and hopeful. They feel like daydreams about love, mischief, and late-night promises. Together, these songs represent the emotional spectrum of love—its ache and its allure.

Beyond the philosophy, Finneas is simply one of the greatest music producers today. His skill and vision are unmatched. I’m still blown away by how he created the hi-hats for _Bad Guy_ using the sound of a pedestrian crossing signal in Australia. He mentioned that on Jimmy Fallon’s show—and I was like, “Whattttt???” God bless him.
