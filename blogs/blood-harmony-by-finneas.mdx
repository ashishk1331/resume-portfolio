I hope you'll read this when its cold, or October last or November.

I've been listening to _Blood Harmony_ constantly for over a week now. It’s one of Finneas’s greatest works. For those who may not know, **Blood Harmony** is the debut EP by Finneas—Billie Eilish’s brother. It was released in October 2019 and contains seven tracks:

1. _"I Lost a Friend"_
2. _"Shelter"_
3. _"Lost My Mind"_
4. _"I Don't Miss You at All"_
5. _"Partners in Crime"_
6. _"Let's Fall in Love for the Night"_
7. _"Die Alone"_

With this, I’m starting a monthly series where I share an album or EP I deeply care about and discuss its tracks and themes.

## Album

I first heard _Blood Harmony_ around the fall of 2021. Since then, at the start of every autumn, either _"Lost My Mind"_ or _"Let's Fall in Love for the Night"_ seems to resurface in my playlists. This year, the flavor lingered longer than usual—so why not share the taste with everyone?

Everyone keeps praising Billie for her voice, and I'm here, star-struck by Finneas's voice. His vocals are warm and full of passion. If I'm out in the open and Finneas’s music starts playing, I’ll run. Run! The music is so exhilarating—like a festival that celebrates being alone. It tells you to trust what once was and what is yet to come.

If I were to use one word to describe the album, it would be ***November***. 🍂

## Cover

The hues of the album cover visually describe what your ears are about to hear once you hit play: a daunting dusk falling over the landscape, bathing it entirely in forsaken love and settled calmness.

Imagine running like Finneas on the cover—down long, empty roads, surrounded by beauty and stillness. It’s quiet, it’s lovely, and every step feels like a heartbeat syncing with the music.

## Tracks

Whenever **let’s fall in love**[6] starts to play, I find myself stirring to the beat. Gradually, you’ll catch yourself standing up and dancing. Soon, the music melts into a soothing jam, and suddenly, you just want to sit somewhere quiet and ponder life.

The music is raw, yet perfect. Every song carries the momentum equally, and there are no skips.

All the tracks combined last a surreal 24 minutes. You’ll lose yourself, find your footing again, only to realize you were already lost to begin with. May this beautiful curse never leave me. I hope it finds me again—in the depths of the sea, in the places I long to be, in the places I wish you were too, and everywhere in between.

The deluxe version adds even more shine to this EP. The tracks feel more refined, and with the addition of the last two songs, you’ll fall in love all over again.

It’s hard to explain music, but this album captures the essence of being alone—brilliantly.

> Maybe I'm just too tired to keep runnin'  
> Maybe you're what I never saw comin'

Reading lines like these brings to mind the thought of Robert Frost going pop.

Now what are you waiting for go and listen to it!
