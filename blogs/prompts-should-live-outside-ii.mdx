This post continues my earlier discussion on placing prompts as templates for GenAI applications outside the code and rendering them with dynamic values. In essence, it reduces the problem to a basic template-based solution. However, in that discussion, I only covered pure text prompts. But what if you also want to share more than just text with LLMs? What about images, PDFs or external links? How to manage them?

## Markdown files

The best format for storing static text along with images and other resources is *Markdown*. You can also extend it with GitHub Flavored Markdown, which supports tables as well.

With Markdown files, you can combine templating to increase the flexibility of prompt templates.
